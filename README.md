# Image-Processing-Algorithms

Comparing image processing speed when applying filters between Python and C++. 

In the first stage, I implement the following filters to test: Gaussian blur, Sobel operator, median filter noise reduction, Canny Edge Detector, Histogram equalization.

Status: Incomplete.

How to use it.

1. Clone the repo and install the following libraries, setup path:

[...]

2. Choose one filter to test (either .py  or cpp). 

3. Run the code. An interactive window will pop up. 

4. Choose the image you want to apply the filter to, and an image will appearon the GUI, showing the results and runtime.

5. Try the same filter with the other language (if you used Python first, switch to C++). And you will see the difference between the two languages.
